# Pytorch Notes for *Dive into Deep Learning*
This repository mainly contains coding notes following *[跟李沐学AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdtFWyvNUcI&list=PLQtPj5OvXSt9SwJnrYu_45_-S6oKQqyxW)* and the *[e-textbook](https://d2l.ai/index.html)*.

The contents updated would be displayed in the catalog below and could be found in the repository by the file postfix "ipynb" with the same name. ***Not all contents*** in the textbook or lectures are docummented here, which is primarily because I select to learn what I need the most and pick up the most valueable points to take notes.
