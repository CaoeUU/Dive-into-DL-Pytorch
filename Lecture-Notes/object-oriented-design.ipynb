    "# Object-Oriented Design for Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To streamline the presentation, we introduce the object-oriented design for implementation. After learning this part, we might have a better understanding of the general framework of some projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, 3 types are included:\n",
    "1. ***Module***: contains models, losses and optimization methods.\n",
    "2. ***DataModule***: data loader for trianing and validation.\n",
    "3. ***Trainer class***: conbine the two classes mentioned above. Most of the time not applied."

    "The bedrock of objects. Originated from the idea that all objects belonging to this class share the attributes or properties, also share the methods (which can be perceived as functions defautly set in the class, and they can be applied to the objects in this class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes class can have attributes that ***don't belong to*** the instances but ***shared*** by all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "***One single class*** can generate ***multiple instances.*** Instance refers to the object generated from the class, but with a name to deviate from the class. A class can be built in with a constructor called ***\\_\\_init\\_\\_***, which would be automatically implement when a class is called, namely an instance is generated. An example shows the typical constructure of the class, derived from the lecture."

We can use a decorator before the definition of one function, or just put that function into the argument of the decorator."
